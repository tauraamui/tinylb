# logging
Very simple logging - Color actually works on Windows

**Log levels**

* Blank - will not show logging output at all
* Info - will show info log output only
* Warn - will show info log output and warnings
* Debug - will show all logs outputs including debug

* Error - this will always get outputted regardless of set log level

**Colors**

By default the whole log line is colored with its corresponding level color however this can be disabled to only color the log level label.
